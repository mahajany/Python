# Example 'for' loop
# First, create a list to loop through:
newList = [45, 'eat me', 90210, "The day has come, the walrus said, \
to speak of many things", -67]

print ("newList[]", newList)
# create the loop:
# Goes through newList, and seqentially puts each bit of information
# into the variable value, and runs the loop
print ("List elements, through for loop:")
for value in newList:
    print ( value )
