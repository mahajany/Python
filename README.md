# Python
Python Scripts which I share with participants for my Python 101 Workshop. 

These are pretty basic scripts - shwoing how to use basic Python programming constructs like variables, loops, conditions, class-definitions etc.  Following topics are covered in these example-scripts: 
* Customary Hello World 
* Variables 
* Loops, conditions etc. 
* Python data-types, including lists and dictionaries 
* Some basic Date-time maths 
* Exception handling 
* Regualr Expressions aka RegEx 
* Defining functions, classes and creating Python modules 
* unittest - not many things are there, but I promise to improve this 
* Interacting with database - examples of CRUD operations with MySQL, PostgreSQL and MongoDB  
* Some basic parsers to fetch JSON, XML 
...etc. 






Most, or in fact almost all of the programs are pulled out from the world's open learning space known as the Internet; and for this I do wish to thank all my known and unknown teachers out there. Please feel free to use these programs / scripts as you wish and share it further; and you're always welcome to report any errors/mistakes/nonsense you spot here.
