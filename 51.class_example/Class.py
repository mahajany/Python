#Dictionaries of Classes

# Again, assume the definitions on Shape,
# Square and DoubleSquare have been run.
# First, create a dictionary:
dictionary = {}

# Then, create some instances of classes in the dictionary:
dictionary["DoubleSquare 1"] = DoubleSquare(5)
dictionary["long rectangle"] = Shape(600,45)

#You can now use them like a normal class:
print ( dictionary["long rectangle"].area() )

dictionary["DoubleSquare 1"].authorName("The Gingerbread Man")
print (dictionary["DoubleSquare 1"].author)
